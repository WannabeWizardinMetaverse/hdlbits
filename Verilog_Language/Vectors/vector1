`default_nettype none     // Disable implicit nets. Reduces some types of bugs.
module top_module( 
    input wire [15:0] in,
    output wire [7:0] out_hi,
    output wire [7:0] out_lo );

    assign out_lo = in[7:0];

NOTE:
1. Vectors are declared as follow: （just ingore the way that the index is from lower to upper）
  <type> [upper:lower] vector_name;

  The type are usually 
  <port type> (e.g., input or output) adding wire or reg.

  For example, when we decalre ports, 
    input wire [15:0] in
    output wire [7:0] out

  Vectors declared in the module such as
    wire [7:0] temp1
    reg [7:0] temp2

2. Implicit nets
   'assign' is also a way to declare vector BUT it could only declare 1-bit vector.
    assign a = 3'b101;  // a = 101
    assign b = a;       // b =   1  implicitly-created wire

3. Unpacked vs. Packed Arrays
   reg [7:0] mem [255:0];   // 256 unpacked elements, each of which is a 8-bit packed vector of reg.
   reg mem2 [28:0];         // 29 unpacked elements, each of which is a 1-bit reg.
