Solution:

module top_module( 
    input [7:0] in,
    output [7:0] out
);
    always@(*)begin
        for(integer i=0; i<8; i=i+1)begin
            out[i]=  in[7-i];
        end
    end
endmodule

NOTE:
it is also correct by arranging the order of the input again but it will be hard to deal with long vector.
the solution given in the website also provides the way by using 'generate' block.
