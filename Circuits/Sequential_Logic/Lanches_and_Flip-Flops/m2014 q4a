Solution:

module top_module (
    input d, 
    input ena,
    output q);
    always@(*)begin
        if(ena)
            q<= d;
        else 
            q<= q;
    end
endmodule

NOTE:
the follows are the hints in the website:
1. Latches are level-sensitive (not edge-sensitive) circuits, so in an always block, they use level-sensitive sensitivity lists.
2. However, they are still sequential elements, so should use non-blocking assignments.
3. A D-latch acts like a wire (or non-inverting buffer) when enabled, and preserves the current value when disabled.
