Solution:

module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input [31:0] in,
    output [31:0] out
);
    reg [31:0]temp_in;
    always@(posedge clk)begin
        temp_in<= in;
        if(reset)
            out<= 0;
        else 
            out<= out|(temp_in&~in);
    end
endmodule

NOTE:
the problem is that the output should be kept to be high, after the falling edge is detected.
Initially, I wanted to use FSM (finite state machines) to figure out this problem. 
but for this problem, considering the relationship between the output could lead me to a simpler solution.
